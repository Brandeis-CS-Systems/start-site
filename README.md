An intentionally minimalist website.

Goal: Launchpad to technical resources for Brandeis CS community members.

Current iteration: "Getting started" links for new students.

Future possible iterations: Content by role (eg: pages for each of prospective/undergrad/masters/PhD students, faculty, etc).

Deployed at: https://start.cs.brandeis.edu/.

Built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).
